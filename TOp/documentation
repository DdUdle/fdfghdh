```

### Configuration File

```bash
# Use configuration file
sudo wnaf -i wlan0 --config /path/to/config.json
```

## Framework Architecture

The framework follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

## Interactive Shell Commands

Once you start the interactive shell, the following commands are available:

```
status       - Display current status
start        - Start the framework
stop         - Stop the framework
interfaces   - Manage wireless interfaces
target       - Manage target APs
clients      - Manage client tracking
channel      - Manage channel hopping
mode         - Set operation mode
scan         - Scan for wireless networks
stats        - Show statistics
config       - Manage configuration
help         - Show help for commands
exit         - Exit the interactive shell
```

For detailed information on each command, use `help <command>`, e.g., `help target`.

## Machine Learning Components

The framework includes several machine learning components:

- **Deep Q-Network**: Reinforcement learning model for action selection
- **Sequence Model**: LSTM-based model for behavioral prediction
- **Device Behavior Model**: Neural network for anomaly detection in device behavior

These components are optional and will be used if TensorFlow or PyTorch are available. Fallback implementations are provided otherwise.

## Security and Privacy Considerations

- All MAC addresses can be anonymized in logs and output
- Sensitive operations require explicit confirmation
- Analysis is passive by default
- Compatible with VPN and Tor for additional anonymity
- Follows responsible disclosure principles

## Advanced Configuration

### Configuring Analysis Settings

Edit the configuration file at `data/configs/default.json` or create a custom one:

```json
{
  "general": {
    "log_level": "INFO",
    "enable_ai": true,
    "evasion_level": 2,
    "anonymize_mac": true
  },
  "attack": {
    "packet_count": 5,
    "deauth_rate": 0.1
  },
  "interfaces": {
    "default": {
      "hop_channels": [1, 6, 11],
      "region": "US" 
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

You can override configuration using environment variables:

```bash
export WNET_GENERAL_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
export WNET_ATTACK_PACKET_COUNT=3
```
